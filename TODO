1. Move all util functions into separate class within the caw.circuits.optimize.util folder
2. Separate linear optimize functions into separate classes, each with its own main and configureable output (decide on an interface to adhere to)
3. Use http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/ CLI to help make it easier to run each optimization function
4. Add package tag to each file and configure maven to build it into a jar for easy running 
5. configure nonlinear optimize package using maven
